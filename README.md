# TicTacToe

### Drake Hunt

This is still a work in progress. It is meant to be a server client version of tic-tac-toe. It will allow two users to play together. At this point the server needs to run and then the client will need work. 

To start the server file needs to run first. After you have started the server you can run the client. Like I said above the client will need work so this program will not run correctly yet. After it is running you would have two clients connect and they will recieve instructions for play.
